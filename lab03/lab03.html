            <p>For me, the hardest part of implementing responsive CSS was trying to figure out how I wanted to use the space efficiently, while also making it look pretty.
                Perhaps I could have done this part better by drawing out what I wanted to do with the space beforehand while keeping in kind of CSS and Bootstrap grid systems, and then tried implementing it in code.
                Other than spacing issues, I also struggled with with media queries when using pure CSS. I mainly struggled with the breakpoints and actually trying to make a noticable difference when changing the width of the screen.
                I was panicking worrying about how nice it would look, when I realized that it shouldn't matter too much in the lab, as long as I actually used them correct (I hope).
                One final issue, is that I struggled getting the CSS and Bootstrap implementations to look EXACTLY the same, however I ended up chalking this up to inexperience with Bootstrap. I might be able to get it to look the same at a later date.

            <p>Moving past those issues I encountered, I found that both methods of implmenting RWD, equally as frustrating and beneficial for me. It's hard for me to pick a favourite between these two, as I believe they both hold their own pros and cons.
                For example, my experience working with CSS to be much more "free", as in, being able to choose my own values and play around with different ones. With Bootstrap, you have to work with these set values denoted by different screen sizes, which makes the experience as a whole much more restricting.
                Another example, is that CSS feels much more harder to work with because of this freedom it allows the user. The grid is something you have to make yourself (despite it being a pretty easy copy paste from the internet). Meanwhile, Bootstrap does this all for you, through classes, which makes the user experience much more streamlined.
