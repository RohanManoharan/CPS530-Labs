            <p class="col-4 col-s-6">Bangladesh is a South Asian country bordered by India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It shares a short border with Myanmar in the southeast. 
                With a population exceeding 170 million, it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. 
                The capital, Dhaka, is a bustling megacity known for its vibrant culture and rapid urbanization.</p>

                <p class="col-4 col-s-6">Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 following a brutal liberation war. 
                Since then, it has developed into a nation with a growing economy, driven by industries such as textiles, agriculture, and remittances from overseas workers. 
                The country is also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its low-lying geography and frequent natural disasters like floods and cyclones.</p>

            <p class="col-4 col-s-6">The country has a rich cultural heritage, deeply rooted in its Bengali language, literature, and traditions. 
                Bengali, the official language, is celebrated worldwide through events like International Mother Language Day. 
                Bangladesh is also famous for its lush greenery, rivers, and the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home to the endangered Bengal tiger.</p>
